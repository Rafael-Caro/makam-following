	<h3>Initilization</h3>
	<p>Start by selecting a recording using the dropdown menu on the upper left corner. Recordings are categorized into 4 makamlar and 6 Us√ºller.</p>
	<p>Upon selection of the recording, load the audio using the "Load Audio" button on the upper right corner. </p>
	<br>
	<h3>Interface</h3>
	<p>When the audio is loaded, the interface will appear on the canvas.
	<p>The relevant information of the record will be desplayed on the screen. For more information, click on "+record info" button on the upper right side. 
	<p>On the center of the screen you will see horizontal lines that are stacked on top of each other with varying distances, corresponding to the perdeler that belong to the Makam creating the melody. Each of the perdeler are indicated here using the logarithmic scale, cents. The numeric values on the right correspond to the distance of the perde to the tonic of the scale. The ones that are defined by the AEU system are presented with their names alongside. The letter that is displayed on the left side of a line correspond to the keyboard element that will create that with the help of the computer keyboard. As the recording plays, the melody will be tracked on this melody line with a red dot. By observing this line and listening to the music together, we wish to improve your appreciation of Turkish/Ottoman Makam Music.</p>
