# makam-following

An audio-visual tool made for helping users understand and appreciate Makam Music. 

The audio recordings are complimented by a visual display which keeps track of the melody on a line that by observing, it strengthens the pitch hight and the note interval perceptions of this Ottoman/Turkish Musical Tradition.

Even though the listener may not be aware of the small interval lengths and the ascending descending characteristic of the Makam Music, seeing the melody visualized on the melody line will give them a better appreciation.

Moreover, the listener can play along with the melody using the computer keyboard which is mapped to the pitches of the melody and loop any section using the loop button above the canvas.
